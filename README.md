## Lyrics

```
CHORUS
fangs out - fangs out motherfucker 
make it further into clear tracks out 
fangs out - fangs out motherfucker 
better reap what you sow
gettin far out of reach so 
ya better run from the spot

VERSE
scent is caught
motherfucker better know these eyes in the whites 
when you dive you will see the bloodshots   
we ain't sleepin' (we be) and circling cages 
with our predatory eyes (so fixed) direct on your folks / fixed on folks

these traps so tight 
can't escape into light
lash out pinned down
you can be sure of bite

we be circling cages
for too long

spotlight on your folk

fangs out fangs out 
 motherfucker better - know the signs 
 fangs out fangs out  look into my eyes, 
calls me out, makes me feel allright   
 and we bleed with red and white
 
 call the wolves, call the wolves
perseverent band of fangs
 pack is angry we collectin stacks, that's right,\
 we bleed red and white
 
 you caught up, brood of fools
 make it count for the crowd
 now you gotta circle back, makes the rules,
 we ain't lettin go, take a step to us
 concrete forest is our life
 city is what makes us us
 face our wrath tonight
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CHORUS
fangs out - fangs out motherfucker 
make it further into clear tracks out 
fangs out - fangs out motherfucker 
better reap what you sow
gettin far out of reach so 
ya better run from the spot

VERSE
scent is caught
motherfucker better know these eyes in the whites 
when you dive you will see the bloodshots   
we ain't sleepin' we be circling cages 
with our predatory eyes fixed on your folks
